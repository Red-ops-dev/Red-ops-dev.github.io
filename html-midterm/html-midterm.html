<!-- 1.Missing doctype declaration <!DOCTYPE html>  added proper formatting with "!" then hitting the enter key
2. Head tag misplaced - moved it below the html language tag (adjusted with the "!" then enter key shortcut)
3. Meta viewport tag was also missing (fixed with "!" and enter key)
4. Meta charset tag was missing (also fixed with "!" and enter key) ** as well as adjusting the title to move it into the document title area
5. html tag should have "lang" not language - changed to lang
6. Head tag had no closing tag - added a closing tag "</head>"
7. h1 not closed - added closing tag
8. paragraph not opened - added opening tag (also added indent with css)
9. incorrect list closing tag - switched to </ol>
10. Paragraph not closed - added closing tag (also added indent with css)
11. No alt attribute - added alt attribute
12. Anchor had incorrect closing tag as </img> - switched it to </a>
13. Line 39 had an opening table tag where it should have been a closing tag - switched it to </td>
14. image tag said "source" instead of "src" - switched to "src"
15. Center tag was used - fixed it with the proper CSS
16. Paragraph had an invalid attribute - fixed it with by changing the css to "background-color"
17. Comment had no closing so the rest of the code was showing up as comments - closed the comment
18. Anchor tag wasn't closed - added a closing anchor tag
19. Emphasis tag was in an incorrect order - switched the nesting to have the emphasis tag close before the paragraph closed ( i then changed it to the "u" element since it says it should be underlined not itallic)
20. Description list elements had incorrect tags - added dt for the item title and dd for the item text
21. I left the button? but it doesn't seem to serve a purpose.
